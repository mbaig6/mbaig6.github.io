			<p> These bullet points are the things that stood out to me the most when watching John Berger's Ways of Seeing. I do not have any knowledge on paintings or artwork, so Berger's videos really shocked me. I was most shcked when I learned that oil paintings were very expensive. Learning that oil paintings were a sign of wealth was very intriguing to me. Berger does have a unique voice which made the videos hard to follow with but the information kept me hooked.
