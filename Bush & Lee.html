	<p> Vannevar Bush raises great points in her article "As We May Think". One point I found very interesting was when she said "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it." In the past, products like type-writers were probably very expensive when they were first introduced. A lot of the machines nowadays do not cost much to make, as several companies out-source their product making. These same companies then sell their products at a ridiculous profit. I am not sure if Bush meant cheap financially but they certainly are not cheap. However, if she meant cheap as in the quality, then I agree with her. A lot of times, phones start acting up when a new one is set to release, which is almost every year. For a $1,000+ phone, it should not start tweaking one year after normal use. </p>

		<p> Bush's comments about selection and organization were very interesting. I think a lot of times, we do not realize how strategic these machines actually are. Files are kept in certain locations, arranged in a specific manner. All of these things seem so normal now, that I often forget how well thought out the design process of our machines are. </p>

	<p> Tim Lee's article also helped me to realize how important design is but if often overlooked. He writes "The primary design principle underlying the Web’s usefulness and growth is universality. When you make a
link, you can link to anything. That means people must be able to
put anything on the Web, no matter what computer they have,
software they use or human language they speak and regardless
of whether they have a wired or wireless Internet connection.
The Web should be usable by people with disabilities. It must
work with any form of information, be it a document or a point
of data, and information of any quality—from a silly tweet to a
scholarly paper. And it should be accessible from any kind of
hardware that can connect to the Internet: stationary or mobile, small screen or large. When I think about it, I never really understood how universal the Worldwide Web is. Ironically, it is in the title, yet still overlooked. Several websites are accessible from almost any part of the world. Growing up in a generation where technology had started to advance significantly, all of these things seem so normal today. In the future generations, telling kids about old school technology might sound like we're talking about the stone age. Lee's article helped me to realize the beauty of technology and the Worldwide Web. " </p>
